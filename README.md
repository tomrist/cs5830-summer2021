### Syllabus for CS 5830

Welcome to CS 5830, Cryptography. We will be studying cryptography, both the
theory and how it is used in practice. By the end of the course you should
understand the basics of cryptography, how cryptographers analyze the
security of cryptographic schemes, and how to choose suitable
cryptographic algorithms within broader projects. 

Classroom: Bloomberg 161 and 165

Instructor: Tom Ristenpart (ristenpart@cornell.edu, https://rist.tech.cornell.edu)

Office hours: By appointment. Don't hesitate to ask!

TA: Julia Len (jl3836@cornell.edu, https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~jlen/)

Office hours: TBA.

### Pre-requisites

Students should have programming experience (we will be focusing on Python),
understand basic probability, know binary representations (ASCII), operations on
bit strings (XOR), have some background on computer networking, file systems,
etc. If in doubt shoot the instructor an email.


### The plan

The class is a 6 week summer session, and as such it's a compacted version of
the more usual 15 week semester-long course on this topic that I teach.  As such
we expect you to spend a good chunk of time during the week on the class, but it
should still not amount to a full time job and we will try to set expectations
realistically. Particularly so given the difficult year we've all had due to the
pandemic. 

The plan is to have a mixture of lectures and reserved time for in class
work with instructors available to help. We'll often refer to those as labs.

We will try to be as flexible as possible regarding in person versus
remote participation. Facilities has set aside a sufficiently large classroom to allow
low density seating, and we will take other precautions to ensure safety for
students and instructors. If you have any concerns please contact Tom [student
services](https://studentservices.tech.cornell.edu/).



### Requirements

The main deliverables will be weekly homework assignments, to be completed
individually or in pairs. The final week the assignment we be paired with a 
take-home exam that will involve questions touching on content from the entire
course. 

Participation is critical! Please engage in lectures and during in-class lab
work.  

* Participation: 20%
* Homeworks:  60% (each homework will count an equal amount)
* Final:  20% 

The homework deliverables schedule is on the syllabus/schedule linked below. 

### Background reading and Lecture notes

The following books should be helpful, but none are required if you don't want
to spend the money and we won't be covering all topics in them. This is more for
the curious student who wants to do additonal reading. 

* [Cryptography 101 by Houtven](https://www.crypto101.io/). Free, but not complete. Feel free to send helpful feedback to the author.

* [Cryptography Engineering by Ferguson, Schneier, and Kohno](https://www.schneier.com/books/cryptography_engineering/). A gentle
  introduction to cryptography.

* [Modern Cryptography by Katz and Lindell](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~jkatz/imc.html). A formal treatment of cryptography.
  We will make reference to, but not go into detail on, topics they treat in
  more detail.
